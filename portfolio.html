                            Participating in the QHack Entrepreneur School, a three-day intensive program, was a pivotal chapter in my professional development. It was an immersive journey where I connected with a dynamic community of aspiring entrepreneurs, collaboratively worked on crafting and validating innovative business ideas, and gained invaluable experience in pitching those ideas to potential investors. This hands-on experience not only enhanced my understanding of the entrepreneurial process but also strengthened my skills in teamwork, strategic planning, and effective communication. QHack left me inspired and more equipped than ever to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the business world.

                            A one-dimensional particle collision simulator developed in Python and Pygame, leveraging principles of physics such as the conservation of momentum and the law of restitution. This simulator models the behavior of three balls contained between two walls, colliding with each other in a continuous loop. Each ball’s restitution coefficient, mass, and velocity are customisable in the code, allowing for detailed exploration of collision dynamics. This project highlights my ability to apply complex mathematical concepts to simulate real-world physics phenomena through code.
